	<h1> How To Build A Job Portfolio</h1>
	
	<h2>Choose A Format For Your Portfolio</h2>
	<p>Your portfolio can take many forms. It can be:</p>
		<p>1.A digital file or set of files.</p>
		<p>2.Your own website.</p>
		<p>3.Pages in a binder, expanding folder, or special box.</p>
		<p>4.A volume that you get professionally bound.</p>
	<p>If you’re planning to give a copy of your digital portfolio to an employer, use a USB flash drive or a link to your website. Whatever form your portfolio takes, it should offer concrete examples that show the abilities and skills you have acquired in your career and life so far.</p>
	<p>Pay close attention to the medium you choose, especially if the job you want requires you to be skilled in a specific medium. For example, if you’re a <a href="https://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/occupations-in-alberta/occupation-profiles/web-designer/" target="blank">web designer,</a> you should build your portfolio online to show your skills. If the position involves public speaking, you could include a video or a link to an online copy of a presentation you have given.</p>
	<h2>Build And Maintain Your Portfolio</h2>
	<p>These 5 steps will help you create a “master” portfolio—a complete collection of all your relevant information and proof of your abilities and skills. Once you have your master copy, you can pick and choose items to create different versions of your portfolio for specific employers.</p> 
	<p>It can take a lot of time to create the master version of your portfolio, but it’s well worth the effort.</p>
	<h2>1.Collect Your Information</h2>
	<p>Your portfolio should highlight your important accomplishments, showcase your knowledge, skills, and creativity, and show your best personal qualities. Your portfolio should always include a copy of your <a href="https://alis.alberta.ca/look-for-work/resumes-and-references/how-to-create-your-master-resume/" target="blank">master resumé.</a> It is the foundation of everything in your portfolio.

	Here are a few categories for you to consider as you search for items to include. Gather everything you can find, including documents, emails, letters, and reports.</p>
	<h2>2.Fill The Gaps</h2>
	<p>If you see gaps in your <a href="https://alis.alberta.ca/look-for-work/recognize-your-accomplishments/" target="blank">accomplishments,</a> think of other ways to show what you have done. If this is not possible, people from your past jobs may be able to help.</p>
	<p>Get in touch with former employers, supervisors, and co-workers and ask them to send you copies of your work from their records.</p>
	<h2>3.Organize The Information</h2>
	<p>Make sure the information in your portfolio is organized in a professional-looking, easy-to-access way. Use whatever approach works for you:</p>
	<p>If you’re using a binder, organize the information with labelled dividers.</p>
	<p>If you’re using a digital format, organize the information in a single document with a hyperlinked table of contents.</p>
	<p>If you’re creating a website for your portfolio, make sure it’s easy to navigate.</p>
	<h2>4.Keep Your Portfolio Up To Date</h2>
	<p>Creating a portfolio is an ongoing process. Get into the habit of documenting and collecting work you are proud of once it’s completed. If you have a regular performance review with your employer, that would also be a good time to update your portfolio and master resumé.</p>
	<p>As you update your achievements, you are also reviewing the skills you’re building. This helps you be ready for a last-minute interview or any other opportunity where you want to show your skills or accomplishments.</p>
